4. What is the best way to remove a line of code from running that you might want to keep as you debug?
   - The best way to temporarily remove a line of code from running, while keeping it for reference or debugging purposes, is to comment out that line. 
   - we can do this by adding // at the beginning of the line for a single-line comment, or by using /* and */ for a multiple-line comment. For example:
     // This line of code is commented out and won't run.
     /* 
     This is a
     commented-out
     block of code.
     */
